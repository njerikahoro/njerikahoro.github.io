                <h2>Early Years</h2>
                <p>I was born in a small village in Kiambu County. 
                    Growing up in the quaint town of Maplewood, nestled amidst rolling hills and verdant landscapes, I was surrounded by the warmth of family and the simplicity of rural life. 
                    My childhood days were spent exploring the woods, climbing trees, and chasing fireflies on summer evenings.
                     It was within the embrace of this close-knit community that I learned the values of honesty, integrity, and compassion that would shape the person I am today
                    
                   </p>
            <h2>Family and Background</h2>
            <p>I was born in a family of 4 two girls two boys and I have both of my parents.
                Growing  up with both my parents and siblings is the best gift I ever received. I always had people to look up to for moral, physical and any other support I would ever need.
                Holidays are important days in our household since they bring us together.

                <h2>Education</h2>
                <p>I attended Makohokoho primary school for my primary education. Attending this school I wouldnâ€™t say was a difficult task as it was in the neighborhood thus the walking distance was short. The school was a conducive place for learning and also instilling discipline was a core aspect. 
                    I joined Our Lady of Fatima Secondary school for my high school education. The institution is built on a strong Christian belief foundation.
                    I later attended Dedan Kimathi University of Technology for my higher education and pursued bachelor of Science in Business Information and Technology. 
                    
                    
                    </p>
                <h2>Personal Growth and Challenges</h2>
                <p>Growing up there were challenges that shaped my life.
                    From betrayal by friends to missing classes and financial struggles in university.
                    Having to be on your own and independence in higher education was a milestone that requires discipline.
                    The challenges in my life have really helped me in upgrading my life and living a better life.

                <h2>Values and Beliefs</h2>
                <p>
                    </p>
                    Values and beliefs are important aspects in my life as they help me shape my life.
                    The values are integrity, compassion, resilience.
                    Personal values influence your behaviors, relationships, and everyday life. They guide you through important decision-making, influence personal development, and carve your ideal career path.
